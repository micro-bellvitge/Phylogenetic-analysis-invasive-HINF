# Phylogenetic-analysis
# Epidemiology and population structure of *Haemophilus influenzae* causing invasive disease

This project was used to understand the population structure of non-typeable *Haemophilus influenzae* (NTHi).

We used R studio and ggplot2 and ggtree packages to observe the phylogenetic distribution of NTHi genomes and its association with metadata, including a clade-related classification based on the presence or abscence of 17 accessory genes.
